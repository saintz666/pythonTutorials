    "* I asked questions. Many questions in fact. Once the case study was given, numerous questions popped up in my mind pertaining to the situation given. Trust me, asking questions help a lot. I realized by asking questions, I was able to solve 40% of the case study.\n",

    "     As a practice, you should spend 1 – 2 hours of distraction free time (no emails, messages and phone calls!) just laying out the structure, possible hypothesis, story flow and a tentative business presentation. Here are a few pics of how I typically layout structure and story flow on paper (Business problem statement: Your Organization has observed increased credit risk in last few months. You need to analyze why this has happened and recommend next steps):\n",

    "\n",
    "* I practiced case studies from different domains like retail, healthcare, technology, sports etc. This made me familiar with their processes and key jargons used. So, during interview I didn’t have to tremble thinking about the type of case study I’ll get.\n",
    "\n",
